This module adds a Temporal tax number, waiting for issue #2874149 to be merged to upstream and tax_number is used. Then if any customers are there, we need to migrate from field tmp_tax_number to tax_number. The changes are taken from the patch #5 but moving to dedicated module replacing all tax_number to tmp_tax_number, after that all commerce_tax namespaces to tmp_tax_number, and the Validator is moved from VatNumber and VatNumberValidator to TmpVatNumber and TmpVatNumberValidator, Outside of the module the only line affected in commerce_tax is modules/tax/src/Plugin/Commerce/TaxType/EuropeanUnionVat.php line 60: "$customer_tax_number = \'\';" to "$customer_tax_number = $customer_profile->get('tmp_tax_number')->value; //waiting for issue #2874149 changed to work with custom module tmp_tax_number."'
